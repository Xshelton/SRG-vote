## Features
## Datasets
By using the Features and Datasets, we can get the dataset for the five-fold cross validation.(TypeA,B)
## Code
Fisrt use the preprocess to generate 10 files(CV typeA) or 11 files(CV typeB, with one more discarded file)  
CV typeB could be used to generate scores for test files the discarded files, as well as novel pairs( as long as those pairs are with the same format as training set)  
## Models

## Results
due to the limitation of 25MB of file for github.  
the file is divided into small files.  
use the combine.py to concate those files into one file.
